The Introduction to bioinformatics is the most interesting course in my first-year study. The class is interesting and active. More communicating on the lecture make it easier to understand new things. But to be honest, sometimes it is a bit too hard for me, especially the game of 24. As I think there is little relation between we have learned in class with the actual practical assignments. Overall, I tried to manage it, but it really takes time. I cannot remember the usage of function or the correlation, and each time I need to search on the Internet for something, such as the usage of re.compile and so on. I have to admit that it did relate to my unpunctual review for the lecture and tutorial, but I think it went faster than I have expected.
Thanks for all members who participated and helped in the first year!
